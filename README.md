# cpp-crash-course-exercises

This repository stores my solutions to the exercises from the book "C++ Crash Course: A Fast Paced Introduction" accessible at https://ccc.codes/. This book is designed to teach the fundamental parts of the language, as well as important libraries and industry standard coding practices. I have included the source files and Visual Studio solution file but not the packages required.
